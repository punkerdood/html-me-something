        <p> A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile...</p>
      <p>And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while.</p>

      <p>But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step</p>
    <p id="long"> A long long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver</p>
<p class="center_thing">With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step</p>
<p>I can't remember if I cried when I 
Read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music
Died

So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die</p>

<article><p>Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died </p></article>

<p>We were singin' bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey 'n' Rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Bye, bye Miss American Pie&#771 &cent</p>
